# Email-client
A responsive web-based email client built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project provides a simple and clean interface for users to sign up, sign in, and manage their emails through different sections like Inbox, Sent, Trash, and Compose Mail.

# Project Overview :
The Email Client simulates the basic UI and flow of an email service.
Users can:
*Create an account (Sign Up)
*Log in to their account (Sign In)
*View their inbox, sent items, and trash
*Compose a new message
*Log out safely... 
Although this version is purely frontend-based, it lays the foundation for full backend integration in the future.
